printf("\nEnter the Basic salary:");                        output:-->>
scanf("%f",&bs);                                            Enter the Basic salary:8000
da=bs*0.4;                                                  Basic salary:8000.000000
hra=bs*0.2;                                                 DA:3200.000000
gs=bs+da+hra;                                               HRA:1600.000000
printf("\nBasic salary:%f",bs);                             Gross salary:12800.000000                              
printf("\nDA:%f",da);
printf("\nHRA:%f",hra);
printf("\nGross salary:%f",gs);
return 0;
}

2.the distance between two cities is input through the keyboard.write a program to convert and print this distance in meters,feet,inch and cm

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    float km,m,cm,i,ft;
    printf("Enter the kilometer :");                       output:-->>
    scanf("%f",&km);                                       Enter the kilometer : 45
    m=km*1000;                                             KM : 45.00
    cm=m*100;                                              M  :45000.00
    i=cm/2.54;                                             CM :4500000.00
    ft=i/12;                                             INCH :1771653.00
    printf("\n KM : %0.2f",km);                            FT :20020124:00
    printf("\n M: %0.2f",m);
    printf("\n CM : %0.2f",cm);
    printf("\n INCH : %0.2f",i);
    printf("\n FT : %o.2f",ft);
    return 0;
}

3.if the marks obtained by astudent in five different subjects are input through the keyboard,find out the aggregate marks aand percentage
  marks obtained by the student.assume that the maximum marks that can be obtained by a student in each subject is 100

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,total;                              output:-->>
    float avg;                                             Enter the 5 subject marks:90,99,98,97,99
    printf("\n Enter the 5 subject marks :");              total:483
    scanf("%d%d%d%d%d",&m1,&m2,&m3,&m4,&m5);               average:96.60
    total=m1+m2+m3+m4+m5;
    avg=total/5.0;
    printf("\n Total :%d",total);
    printf("\n average:%0.2f",avg);
    return 0;
}
